# Abspiel Server - Client Prototyp

This prototype consists of a JEE RESTful Webservice providing a mp3-file and a simple HTML/JavaScript Client fetching this mp3-file
and playing it in the browser. The client represents the "Abspiel Client" of our system architecture. We simple had one problem with the
client: Firefox does not support mp3-format and you can not play a mp3-audio in Firefox as easy as in Chrome. So we are currently searching 
for a solution, worst case: we simply do not support Firefox. [Here](https://support.mozilla.org/de/kb/html5-video-und-audio-firefox) is a link were the problem is described.
