# Initialize Database

This Java SE program is here to set up the database of our JEE-Server (see at the system architecture). 
You simply specify where all your mp3-file,s you want to add, are (parent folder). This program then scans throw all the subfolder
and stores the mp3-filepaths and all their meta data in the database, so we can search for them at a later point in time.
